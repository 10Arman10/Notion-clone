# Notion
This project is not a ordinary Notion clone my take on Notion is with AI.
With the help of python I added AI to my project such as
1.Virtual Keyboard.
2.Virtual Mouse.
And with the help of Flask I connected them to my website and it worked perfectly.

Also a cool feature I added is a Text to Speech to my project to make it unique.
I added the TTS by the Web Speech API , which basiaclly helps you to add tasks sucs as Parapgraps, To-Do lists exc. 

this is screenshot to better understand what my clone of Notion looks like.
